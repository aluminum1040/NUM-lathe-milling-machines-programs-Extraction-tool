# NUM-lathe-milling-machines-programs-Extraction-tool

I made this 2 little scripts to extract individual programs from a full memory dump of a NUM 1040 machines.
I offer these scripts (ugly but functional) as open source (GNU GPL v3 licence).

In order to work, the raw memory dumps files must be placed in the same folder that the scripts provided.
And also be named with lower-case extension .txt
Launch the script extraction-progs-machines.sh (either under Linux, either under Windows using WSL or Cygwin)
