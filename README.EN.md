# NUM-lathe-milling-machines-programs-Extraction-tool

I made this 2 little scripts to extract individual programs from a full memory dump of a NUM 1040 machines.
I offer these under GNU free licence

In order to work, the raw memory dumps files must be placed in the same folder that the scripts provided.
And also be named with lower-case extension .txt
